# Zhian's Learning Rust

This is a repository for me to go through the [rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/)

I was previously only aware of the documentation via the web, but I occasionally
find myself wanting to practice without needing the internet. The solution is to
use the command:

```
rustup doc
```
